In the real world there is nothing wrong with that.
That is true for every member of Parliament.
I would think this is not at all what we want to do here.
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.
The good news is that Canada Post is listening.
We have to ask why.
Many Liberal members come from rural ridings.
We live in a democracy.
I cannot imagine anything so ridiculous.
In my opinion the nays have it.
All members of all parties are aware of these programs.
We do not intend to stop that.
Let us meet our Kyoto commitments.
The Minister of Finance has made deep cuts to provincial transfers.
Let us get on with it and continue to engage in debate.
We are suggesting that we could pass a better bill.
This is reminiscent of the Liberal way of doing things.
The Prime Minister will determine who the president of the council will be.
Clearly it is a conflict of interest situation.
We welcome the opportunity.
I declare the motion lost.
And more than five members having risen:
I do not think a union is the key to solving the problem.
I commend the member for Winnipeg centre for bringing forward this bill.
Something has to change.
